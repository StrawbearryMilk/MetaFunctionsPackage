# MetaFunctionsPackage
Package I made for my meta-analysis research (and my very first one!). 
I used specific parameters for different types of studies, so this was made to reduce the repitition of copying, pasting, and renaming several clusters of R Markdown lines.
Contains functions for interactive funnel plot creation, an effect size computer, meta object creator (with specified parameters), and a meta regression computer. 

Updated as I see fit for different parameter settings, or major changes in functions if I make changes in how my data is read in.
